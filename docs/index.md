# Viral Orthology

A modular bioinformatics pipeline for automated orthology inference across viral genomes using complementary sequence, profile, synteny, compositional, and structural evidence.

<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">WARNING</p>
<p>Viral Orthology is currently undergoing a major rewrite focused on improving code quality, modularity, maintainability, and test coverage. The rewrite is still under active development and <b>is not yet ready for installation or use</b>.</p>

## Key Features

- Automated orthology inference across viral genomes
- Iterative refinement of orthologous groups
- Support for large viral genome datasets
- Configurable parameters for integrated bioinformatics tools
- Independent enrichment and analysis modules
- Synteny detection based on gene-order conservation
- Amino acid composition analysis
- Protein secondary and tertiary structure analysis

## Installation

### Requirements

- Linux
- Conda (or Miniconda)

### Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viralorthology/viral-orthology/refs/heads/main/setup.sh | bash
```

The required dependencies are installed automatically through the Conda environment.

### Verify installation

```bash
viralorthology -h
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Prepare the input

Create a file named `ids.txt` containing the GenBank accession IDs of the viral genomes to be analyzed:

```text
NC_XXXXX
NC_XXXXX
NC_XXXXX
```

### 2. Retrieve sequences

```bash
viralorthology -download_seqs
```

This command retrieves the required genomic and protein sequence data and prepares the input for downstream analysis.

### 3. Run the core pipeline

```bash
viralorthology -pipeline
```

The core workflow performs the initial orthology inference and iterative refinement of the resulting orthologous groups.

### 4. Run enrichment and analysis modules

Once the orthologous groups have been generated, independent enrichment and analysis modules can be executed as needed.
